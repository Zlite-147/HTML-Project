    <h2 class="article__title"> Wireless Communication </h2>

    <p class="p">Li-Fi (short for light fidelity) is a technology for wireless communication between devices using light to transmit data. In its present state only LED lamps can be used for the transmission of visible light. The term was first introduced by Harald Haas during a 2011 <a href="https://www.ted.com/attend/conferences/tedglobal">TEDGlobal talk</a>  in Edinburgh.In technical terms, Li-Fi is a visible light communications system that is capable of transmitting data at high speeds over the visible light spectrum, ultraviolet and infrared radiation.
      </p>

    <p class="p">As we now know, Li-Fi is a Visible Light Communications (VLC) system. This means that it accommodates a photo-detector to receive light signals and a signal processing element to convert the data into 'stream-able' content.

An LED light bulb is a semiconductor light source meaning that the constant current of electricity supplied to an LED light bulb can be dipped and dimmed, up and down at extremely high speeds, without being visible to the human eye.

For example, data is fed into an LED light bulb (with signal processing technology), it then sends data (embedded in its beam) at rapid speeds to the photo-detector (photodiode).

The tiny changes in the rapid dimming of LED bulbs is then converted by the 'receiver' into electrical signal.

The signal is then converted back into a binary data stream that we would recognise as web, video and audio applications that run on internet enables devices.</p>

    <p class="p"><br>Benefits of LiFi:<br><a href="http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/LiFi-vs-WiFi.html">Higher speeds than Wi-Fi</a>
    <br>
    10000 times the frequency spectrum of radio.<br>
    More secure because data cannot be intercepted without a clear line of sight.<br>
    Prevents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piggybacking_(data_transmission)">piggybacking</a> .<br>
    Eliminates neighboring network interference.<br>
    Unimpeded by radio interference.<br>
    Does not create interference in sensitive electronics, making it better for use in environments like <a href="http://www.globallifitech.com/en/images/hopitale-001.jpg">hospitals</a> and <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-549b230a3d8edf2b0c5d2c40cffe9985-c">aircraft</a> .<br>

    <p class="p">By using LiFi in all the lights in and around a building, the technology could enable greater area of coverage than a single WiFi router. Drawbacks to the technology include the need for a clear line of sight, difficulties with mobility and the requirement that lights stay on for operation. </p>

      <p class="p">Modulation techniques for light fidelity (LiFi) are reviewed in this paper. LiFi is cellular wireless networking (re)using lights. Specifically, light emitting diodes (LEDs) are used in LiFi as visible light transmitters. This means future lighting systems fulfil two functions: high speed wireless networking and illumination. LiFi supports multiuser access and handover to enable mobile services. Since LED lights emit incoherent light only intensity modulation and direct detection can be used. Single carrier modulation techniques are straightforward to implement, but for data rates higher than about 15 Mbps computationally complex equalization techniques are required in frequency selective LiFi channels. Moreover, single carrier techniques suffer from DC wander effects. Alternatively, multicarrier modulation techniques offer a viable solution for high speed LiFi in terms of power efficiency, spectral efficiency and computational efficiency. In particular, <a href="http://www.wirelesscommunication.nl/reference/chaptr05/ofdm/images/fig2.gif">orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) </a>based modulation techniques offer a practical solution as they are based on fast Fourier transformations for which very computational effective digital signal processing implementations exist. LiFi modulation techniques need to also satisfy illumination requirements. Flickering avoidance and dimming control are considered in the variant modulation techniques presented. This paper surveys the suitable modulation techniques for LiFi including those which explore time, frequency and colour domains.</p>

    
    <p class="p">Lifi is not the replacement of wifi technology. It can be considered as incredible companion of the wifi technology. It operates between 380 nm to 780 nm optical range. LiFi is used to exchange data incredibly rapidly and securely at much lower power level compare to WiFi. </p>

    <p>LiFi is high speed bi-directional networked and mobile communication of data using light.LiFi comprises of multiple light bulbs that form a wireless network, offering a substantially similar user experience to Wi-Fi except using the light spectrum.
        <br><br>
     LiFi is a category of Optical Wireless Communications (OWC). OWC includes infra-red and ultra-violet communications as well as visible light. However, LiFi is unique in that the same light energy used for illumination may also be used for communication.

     The term LiFi was coined by pureLiFi CSO,<a href="https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/prof-harald-haas">Professor Harald Haas</a> , at a TedGlobal Talk back in 2011 where he demonstrated LiFi for the first time.
